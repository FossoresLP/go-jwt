RS Algorithms for JWT / JWS
===========================

This package implements a verification and siging provider using the RS algorithms for JWT / JWS.

Please note that this package currently has no unit test and instead relies on integration tests.

Changes to the signing and verification process are also validated against [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) but this is currently done manually.
