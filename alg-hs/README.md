HS Algorithms for JWT / JWS
===========================

This package implements a verification and siging provider using the HS algorithms for JWT / JWS.

Please note that this package currently is not fully covered by unit test and instead uses integration tests for some parts.

Changes to the signing and verification process are also validated against [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) but this is currently done manually.
