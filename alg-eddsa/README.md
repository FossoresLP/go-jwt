EdDSA Algorithm for JWT / JWS
=============================

This package implements a verification and siging provider using the EdDSA algorithms for JWT / JWS as specified in RFC 8037.

Please not that this package is currently only tested against itself since there are not many implementations of RFC 8037 out there.
